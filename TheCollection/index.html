        Item: #1 Pokemon Trading Cards
    </h2>
    <h4>
        I have been collecting <strong>Pokemon Trading Cards</strong> 
        for over a decade. My collection includes some of the rarest full art cards that would sell for quite some money. 
        <br>
        These cards are very valuable and are not just regular pieces of paper;
        they are <em>artifacts of history</em> coming from many different generations and decades.
        <br>
        I have cards from different generations of pokemon from the first generation to the latest generation. 
        My collection include some of the rarest full arts, ex, gx, and v cards. 
        <br>
        If you are looking for a card, 
        I probably have it in my collection.
    </h4>
    <h4>
        I am selling my collection because I need enough money to pay my tuition bill. 
        I am looking for a buyer who will appreciate the value of these cards and take good care of them.
        <br>
        These cards are very special to me, and I want them to go to a good home.
        I am looking for <strong>real offers</strong> only, and I am <strong><em>not</em></strong> interested in trading.
        I take cash, paypal, zelle, and venmo. 
        <br>
        Shipping is available, but I will not ship until I receive payment.
        Shipping is <strong><em>not</em></strong> included in the price.
        If you do not have the money to buy these cards, please do not waste my time.
